# arguments

// just a reminder how this works

	- bash script.sh <enter_the_argument>
	- bash script.sh <enter_the_arguments>

- ls -l (this is also an argument)

- one useful case is to use arguments in for example such a script
  which is used to make backups and everytime we can specify the
  directory as an argument with command to back things up at.

- $# tells us the number of arguments user has passwed into the script.
