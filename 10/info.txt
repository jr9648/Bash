# This folder might not contain any scripts as such but some information only

// Where to store scripts so all the necessary users have access to it
-->
	- Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
	- So according to FHS, we can store scripts into /usr/local/bin
	- So when running scripts from anywhere we will not be required to specify
	  the exact path to the script. (how?)
	- $PATH variable contains all of the directories inside of it that shell will
	  look inside of to find a script or binary it could run.
	- echo $PATH 
	- To add path into PATH
		export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
	  This will add the specified path with all the paths that were already
	  present in $PATH

// Remember file extensions are not required in linux at all
-->
	- Hence giving .sh is just for users not for linux
	- for example if it's a python script extension does not matter until and unless
	  we have shebang defined properly
	- shebang tells linux how to run scripts and that is enough
