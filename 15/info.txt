# In this section we will be using 'cron' to schedule jobs

// Pre-requisite information
	
	- use fully qualified commands; two reasons for that :-
		-- cracker can put harmfull scripts named 'echo' or something like this
		   which can become a security vulnerability to the system.
		-- sometimes scripts might not run in standard shell environment, so PATH
		   variable might not be actually the same when you are doing that manually. 

// cron
	- crontab -e
	- the file will open in tmp, this does not means that
	  the file is actually located there. It is a temporary file and is
	  saved in right place after getting checked for any typos or errors by
	  cron.
	- we have legend in the crontab file to schedule our tasks
	- m h dom mon dow command
		-- minute hours day_of_month month day_of_week command
		-- 30 * * * * /usr/local/bin/<script_name>
		--- it means the script will run at 30 minutes of every hour, each day of the month, every month, every day of the week
		<?> 0/7 for sunday and {1..6} for monday to saturday
	- crontab -u <user> -e : to run the script
