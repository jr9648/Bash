// standard output
-->
	- we do ls and it prints output with exit code equals to 0
	- find command will give both std output and std error
	- designated by 1
		- hence 'find /etc -type f 1> /dev/null' will send standard
		  output to null
	- or can be send to a file

// standard error
-->
	- we cd into non existent directory and it gives exit code not equal to 0
	- designated by 2
		- hence 'find /etc -type f 2> /dev/null' will send standard
                  error to null
	- or can be send to a file

<?> To send both std output and std error to null or to a file,
    we can use '&'
	- hence 'find /etc -type f &> /dev/null' will send both
	  null
	- 'find /etc -type f 2> error.log 1> success.log' we can user
	  command like this to save standard error and standard output
	  separately in a file.

// standard input
-->
	- we use 'read' to get standard input
